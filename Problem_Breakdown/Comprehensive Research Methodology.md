# Comprehensive Research Methodology â€“ EV Market Analysis 

This document outlines the end-to-end approach followed by all three teams to collect, analyze, and derive strategic insights for EV market entry in India.

---

## ðŸ§  1. Problem Understanding

- Team 1: Defined vehicle category-based segmentation (2W vs 4W) and demand analysis.
- Team 2: Focused on user behavior, income, psychographics, and age-based personas.
- Team 3: Mapped geo-environmental data and aligned regional adoption models.

---

## ðŸ“Š 2. Data Collection

- Team 1:
  - VAHAN datasets (EV registrations by type & state)
  - Government PCS reports (charging infra)
- Team 2:
  - Survey data from Kaggle (buyer behavior, preferences)
  - Census and NSSO for income & demographic data
- Team 3:
  - State-wise pollution data
  - Geo-mapping datasets and regional EV policies

---

## ðŸ§¹ 3. Data Preprocessing

- Team 1:
  - Cleaned vehicle category data
  - Merged registration and charging station counts
- Team 2:
  - Handled survey nulls, normalized demographic columns
- Team 3:
  - Unified spatial and pollution datasets, matched geo-points

---

## ðŸ§ª 4. Analysis Tools and Techniques

- All teams used:
  - Python, Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  - Google Colab notebooks, jupyter notebooks
- Team 1: Clustering for 2W/4W segmentation
- Team 2: Correlation analysis between age, income, and buying behavior
- Team 3: Geo heatmaps, pollution-EV correlation

---

## ðŸ“ˆ 5. Modeling and Segmentation

- Team 1:
  - Clustered states for 2W and 4W category targeting
- Team 2:
  - Created buyer personas and demographic clusters
- Team 3:
  - Developed regional readiness models based on policy, pollution, and infra

---

## ðŸ§© 6. Strategic Document Development

- Team 1: `Vehicle_Category_Strategy.md` â€“ Entry strategy for 2W/4W
- Team 2: `Demographic_Targeting_Strategy.md` â€“ Buyer persona-driven targeting
- Team 3: `Geographical_Expansion_Strategy.md`, `Environmental_Positioning_Strategy.md`

---

## âœ… Summary

The combined research methodology ensured every aspect of Indiaâ€™s EV market was explored from:
- Category demand (Team 1)
- Human behavior (Team 2)
- Environmental and geo-readiness (Team 3)

This holistic, multi-team structure resulted in actionable, data-driven strategic recommendations.
