## 🎯 Why Market Segmentation?

Market segmentation helps divide the broad EV market into smaller, meaningful groups that share common characteristics. This allows us to:
- Understand user needs better
- Target the right audience effectively
- Design focused pricing and product strategies

## 🧩 Types of Segmentation Used

We will use a mix of the following segmentation types based on available data:

### 1. 📍 Geographic Segmentation

- **By State**: EV-friendly policies (e.g., Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra)
- **By City Tier**: Tier-1 (Bangalore, Delhi) vs Tier-2/3 (Indore, Kochi)
- **By EV Infrastructure**: Charging station availability, EV density

### 2. 👤 Demographic Segmentation

- **Age Group**: 20–35 (young professionals), 35–50 (family buyers)
- **Income Level**: Low (< ₹3L), Middle (₹3–10L), High (> ₹10L)
- **Occupation**: Tech professionals, delivery drivers, business owners

### 3. 🧠 Psychographic Segmentation

- **Eco-consciousness**: Willing to adopt green technologies
- **Tech Adoption Attitude**: Early adopters vs risk-averse individuals
- **Lifestyle**: Urban convenience seekers vs rural utility buyers

### 4. 📊 Behavioral Segmentation

- **Usage Pattern**: Daily commute, last-mile delivery, shared mobility
- **Brand Loyalty**: Preference for Tata, Ola Electric, Ather, etc.
- **Incentive Sensitivity**: Buyers responding to subsidies or tax rebates

## 🔍 Data-Driven Segmentation (Clustering)

We will apply **clustering techniques** to group customers or regions based on:
- EV registration density
- Charging station availability
- Average vehicle usage per region
- Socio-economic indicators

📌 The clustering will help uncover **hidden patterns** and recommend optimal segments to target.

## 📁 Data Sources to Support Segmentation

- **VAHAN Dashboard** – Vehicle registration data
- **BEE India / EV Yatra Portal** – Charging station availability
- **Census data / NSSO** – Demographic and income data
- **Survey data** (if available) – For psychographic and behavioral profiling

## ✅ Summary

Our segmentation strategy uses:

- Geography for targeting EV-ready regions
- Demographics for income & age targeting
- Psychographics to understand mindset
- Clustering for data-driven grouping

This framework enables a focused and feasible EV market entry strategy tailored to real user segments.
