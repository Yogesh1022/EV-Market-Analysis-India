## üìò What is the Technology Adoption Lifecycle?

The Technology Adoption Lifecycle is a model that explains how different groups of people adopt new technologies over time. It includes 5 stages:

1. **Innovators** ‚Äì Risk-takers who adopt new tech first.
2. **Early Adopters** ‚Äì Influential trendsetters; open to new ideas.
3. **Early Majority** ‚Äì Cautious but open to innovation once proven.
4. **Late Majority** ‚Äì Skeptical; adopt only when mainstream.
5. **Laggards** ‚Äì Last to adopt, often resistant to change.

### ‚úÖ Early Adopters in India

- **Urban, tech-savvy individuals** (e.g., Bangalore, Delhi NCR, Hyderabad)
- **Young professionals** with environmental awareness
- **Startups and last-mile delivery services** using electric 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers
- **High-income EV car buyers** (e.g., Tata Nexon EV, MG ZS EV)
