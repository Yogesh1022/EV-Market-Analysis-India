## ðŸš— Fermi Estimation - EV Market Size in India

Fermi estimation is a technique for making approximate calculations with limited data. Here's an estimate of the early EV market in India:

Total population of India: 1.4 billion
Urban population â‰ˆ 35% â†’ 490 million
Assume 5% are early adopters â†’ 24.5 million
Of those, 10% can afford EVs now â†’ 2.45 million potential early buyers
This gives a rough early market size of ~2.5 million EV users in urban India.

## Problem Decomposition
To address the EV market strategy problem, we break it down into the following sub-problems:

# What vehicle categories are most viable?

   2-wheelers (for city users, low cost)
   3-wheelers (logistics/delivery use)
   4-wheelers (private cars or shared taxis)
   Buses (public transport)

# What regions show the highest EV interest?

   States with favorable policies and EV subsidies
   Urban cities with higher pollution and awareness (e.g., Delhi, Bangalore)

# What customer segments to target?

   Early tech adopters
   Delivery businesses (B2B)
   Middle-income individuals in Tier-1 cities

# What infrastructure factors matter?

   Charging station availability
   Battery-swapping support

# What government support exists?

   FAME II scheme
   State-level incentives

## Summary

This decomposition and estimation help us narrow down:

   **Target customers** (urban, middle-income, early adopters)
   **Vehicle types** (2W/3W for B2C and B2B)
   **Geographies** (Tier-1 cities with policies and infrastructure)

Weâ€™ll now proceed with data collection and clustering to validate these assumptions.
