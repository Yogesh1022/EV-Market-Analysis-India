# Six-Point Analysis Framework – EV Market Strategy

This framework brings together the key dimensions used by all three teams to analyze and design a go-to-market strategy for electric vehicles in India.

---

## 1. Market Demand Analysis 

- VAHAN data used to analyze EV registration trends by state and vehicle type.
- Deep-dive into **2W and 4W category adoption** from 2018–2023.
- Identified demand hotspots for early entry (Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra).

---

## 2. Infrastructure Availability

- Team 1 extracted and structured public charging station data from official reports.
- Team 3 mapped **state-wise EV infrastructure vs population and density**.
- Derived features like **EVs per PCS**, and **infra readiness index** per state.

---

## 3. Consumer Behavior and Psychographics 

- Analyzed survey data from Kaggle and other sources.
- Segmented users by **age, income, environmental concern, lifestyle**.
- Mapped psychographic trends to vehicle category and region.

---

## 4. Competitive Landscape

- Team 1 analyzed brand presence in 2W/4W segments (Ather, Ola, Tata).
- Team 2 and 3 tracked **regional dominance and policy impact** on players.
- Highlighted underserved markets and high-competition zones.

---

## 5. Policy and Regulatory Support

- Evaluated **FAME II**, state-level subsidy schemes, and tax waivers.
- Created a **state policy index** to rank policy support.
- Integrated pollution data to justify regulatory push (e.g., Delhi, Punjab).

---

## 6. Technology & Adoption Readiness

- Mapped **tech-savvy, urban states** to early adopter profile.
- Used clustering + demographic scoring to rank readiness.
- High readiness found in metro cities with active EV policies and buyer interest.

## ✅ Summary

This six-point framework provided a multi-dimensional approach to India’s EV market analysis by combining:
- Vehicle category segmentation (Team 1)
- Consumer targeting (Team 2)
- Geo-infra-policy mapping (Team 3)

It enabled a **data-driven**, collaborative strategy to define market entry points and audience focus.
