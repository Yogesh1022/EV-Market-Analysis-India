# Guide to the Six-Point Methodology
This guide serves as a reference for team members on applying our standardized Six-Point Analysis Framework.

1.  **Market Size & Growth:**
    - Always use official sources (VAHAN, SIAM) for baseline data.
    - Clearly state all assumptions used in CAGR projections.
2.  **Vehicle Category:**
    - Analyze each category (2W/4W/CV) independently before comparing.
    - Focus on segment-specific drivers (e.g., TCO for CVs, Style for 2Ws).
3.  **Consumer & Demographics:**
    - Cross-reference survey data with census/NSSO data for validation.
    - Ensure all segments are MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).
4.  **Geographical Intelligence:**
    - Use standardized city tiers (Metro, T1, T2).
    - Layer data on maps: registrations, charging points, dealer networks.
5.  **Policy & Environment:**
    - Differentiate between central (FAME) and state policies.
    - When discussing pollution, use official CPCB AQI data.
6.  **Competition & Technology:**
    - Perform a standardized SWOT for the top 3 competitors in each segment.
    - Base technology assessments on current, commercially available tech.

This framework ensures all reports and analyses are consistent, comprehensive, and comparable.
